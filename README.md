# Default CI templates

This repo contains a series of templates that is used inside the CI/CD pipeline of JTM.

The syntax here is valid for a Gitlab CI setup. Our current version of Gitlab is 12.9.0

At Jobtome, we use GCP as our Cloud provider, hence you can imagine a lot of pipelines are related/applicable to GCP. Also, we use three main regions for our services, so you will see a lot of references about that distinction.

We manage our GCP infrastructure through Terraform, thus you can find also terraform-related pipeline files. Have a look at our [tf GCP modules](https://github.com/jobtome-labs/terraform-modules), too, if you also manage GCP through Terraform!

## Pipeline order and workflow

With Kubernetes:

`lint -> build -> test -> push -> manifest -> deploy -> rollback -> notify`

With Helm:

`lint -> build -> test -> push -> deploy  -> notify`

Rollback is not necessary thanks to Helm's atomic operations (if the installing fails, Helm cleans up by itself)

Our workflow:
- A commit on master goes to quality
- A tag on master promotes to production

### Folder structure
For kubernetes regional projects:
```
my-project
|_ src
|_ kube
   |_production
      \_hpa.yaml
   |_quality
      \_hpa.yaml
  \_deployment.yaml
  \_other-files-common-to-prod-and-qa.yaml
.gitlab.ci.yml
...other files
```

For kubernetes multiregional projects:
```
my-project
|_ src
|_ kube
   |_production
     |_production_asia
        \_hpa.yaml
     |_production_america
        \_hpa.yaml
     |_production_europe
        \_hpa.yaml
   |_quality
      \_hpa.yaml
  \_deployment.yaml
  \_other-files-common-to-prod-and-qa.yaml
.gitlab.ci.yml
...other files
```

For terraform projects:
```
my-project
|_ platform
  \_main.tf
  \_output.tf
  ...
.gitlab.ci.yml
...
```

### How to use it

If you're an operations team, a devops, or if you know very well what you're doing, copy the relevant part from this readme to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. You can also override some operations by overriding the stages or the operation itself.

A note on gitlab-ci syntax:

```yaml
include:
  - project: 'group/reponame'
    ref: v1.0.2
    file: 'test-unit.yml'
```

will import the code from another Gitlab project

```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jobtome-labs/ci-templates/v1.1.0/test-unit.yml'
```

will import the code from an external repository; notice ref and filename are embedded into the URL.

**Throughout the readme, the tag section will be a placeholder**.

## Linting

The stage `lint` will perform at least 2 checks:
- lint:docker (checks the Dockerfile(s) against good practices)
- lint:yaml (checks the yaml format of the manifests against good practices)

Additionally it will perform the linting of the selected languages. All is needed to do is to specify the file to import as `lint-go.yml` or `lint-php.yml`.

```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jobtome-labs/ci-templates/<REF>/lint-go.yml'

stages:
  - lint

variables:
  #optional, used by docker-lint
  IGNORE_DOCKER_LINT: "DL3012"
```

The default skipped test for `lint-docker` is `Provide an email address or URL as maintainer`. See skippable tests [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/hadolint/hadolint).

If one wants to check the kube manifests (through lint and security practices), then the import becomes `test-kubernetes-score.yaml`, and it will perform the following:

- lint:kubernetes (checks the object's manifests against their schema)
- test:kubernetes-score (checks the manifests against good practices)

```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jobtome-labs/ci-templates/<REF>/test-kubernetes-score.yml'

stages:
  - lint

variables:
  #optional, used by kube-score
  IGNORE_TESTS: "container-security-context pod-networkpolicy label-values"
```

Notice by default three kube-score tests are excluded (the ones indicated above). If you want to run it 'strict', do declare `IGNORE_TESTS` as empty string; otherwise you can avoid declaring it.

See [here](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score/blob/master/README_CHECKS.md) for skippable tests.

NB: The test `label_values` needs to be skipped because of the values `${CI_COMMIT_TAG}` (which will be replaced by `envsubst` later in the pipeline) causing validation fail.

# Unit test stage

```yaml
include:
  remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jobtome-labs/ci-templates/<REF>/test-unit.yml'

stages:
  - test

variables:
  TEST_CONTAINER_NAME: "app" #Default value
  COMPOSER_FILE_NAME: "docker-compose.test.yml" #Default value
```

This will spin up a `docker-compose.test.yml` and check the exit code of the container `app`. If the file is not named `docker-compose.test.yml`, or the test container is not named `app`, the variables are there to correct the names.

## Docker pipeline

```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jobtome-labs/ci-templates/<REF>/docker.yml'

  SECRET_YAML_PRODUCTION_ASIA: <secret base64 encoded>
  DOMAIN_PRODUCTION_ASIA: as.production.example.com
```

## Note on configmaps
In order to deploy configmaps at every run (not just after the manual stage of "manifest") one can use this code:

1. Remember to add among the `variables:` the `BEFORE_CUSTOM_APPLY_FILE_PATH: "/tmp/before-manifest.yaml"`
2. Use the following snippet for regional deployments

```yaml
deploy:quality:image:
  before_script:
    - &deployconfig |
      # DEPLOY CONFIGMAP PHASE

      if [ -z "${ENVIRONMENT}" ]; then
        ENVIRONMENT=production
      fi

      if [ -z "${KUBERNETES_DIR}" ]; then
        KUBERNETES_DIR=kube
      fi

      envsubst < "${KUBERNETES_DIR}"/"${ENVIRONMENT}"/configmap.yaml >> "${BEFORE_CUSTOM_APPLY_FILE_PATH}"

deploy:production:image:
  before_script:
    - *deployconfig
```

If the deployment is not regional but multiregional, use this [NB there are more variables to add in this case, such as `ENVIRONMENT_PATH_ASIA; ENVIRONMENT_PATH_EUROPE; ENVIRONMENT_PATH_AMERICA`]:

```yaml
deploy:quality:image:
  before_script:
    - &deployconfig |
      # DEPLOY CONFIGMAP PHASE

      if [ -z "${ENVIRONMENT}" ]; then
        ENVIRONMENT=production
      fi

      if [ "${ENVIRONMENT}" != "quality" ]; then
        if [ "${ENVIRONMENT_NAME}" == "production-asia" ]; then
          ENVIRONMENT="${ENVIRONMENT_PATH_ASIA}"
        fi
        if [ "${ENVIRONMENT_NAME}" == "production-europe" ]; then
          ENVIRONMENT="${ENVIRONMENT_PATH_EUROPE}"
        fi
        if [ "${ENVIRONMENT_NAME}" == "production-america" ]; then
          ENVIRONMENT="${ENVIRONMENT_PATH_AMERICA}"
        fi
      fi

      if [ -z "${KUBERNETES_DIR}" ]; then
        KUBERNETES_DIR=kube
      fi

      envsubst < "${KUBERNETES_DIR}"/"${ENVIRONMENT}"/configmap.yaml >> "${BEFORE_CUSTOM_APPLY_FILE_PATH}"

deploy:production:asia:image:
  before_script:
    - *deployconfig

deploy:production:america:image:
  before_script:
    - *deployconfig

deploy:production:europe:image:
  before_script:
    - *deployconfig
```

## Kubernetes "simple script" pipeline

```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jobtome-labs/ci-templates/<REF>/kubernetes-task.yml'

stages:
  - deploy

variables:
  NAMESPACE: 'my-namespace'

  # PRODUCTION VARIABLES
  CLUSTER_NAME_PRODUCTION: 'production-europe-west1'
  CLUSTER_ZONE_PRODUCTION: 'europe-west1-b'
  KUPDATE_SCRIPT: |
                  kupdate resource-1 && \
                  kupdate resource-2 && \
                  kupdate statefulset resource-3
```

If there is only one argument, then the resource type "deployment" is intended. Explicitly give a different resource type e.g. "statefulset" in other cases.

## Helm deployment

Just like k8s, but with some additional variables

```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jobtome-labs/ci-templates/<REF>/helm-{quality|regional|multiregion}.yml'

stages:
  - build
  - push
  - deploy

variables:
  IMAGES: "app nginx"
  APP_NAME: "myapp"
  GOOGLE_PROJECT: "my-project"
  CHARTS_URL: "https://my-chart-bucket-name.cloudstorage.provider.com"
  CHART_NAME: "my-app-chart"


  # QUALITY VARIABLES
  CLUSTER_NAME_QUALITY: quality
  CLUSTER_ZONE_QUALITY: europe-west1-b
  DOMAIN_QUALITY: quality.example.com
  NAMESPACE_QUALITY: "my-namespace"

  # if needed:
  # PRODUCTION EUROPE VARIABLES
  ...
  # PRODUCTION AMERICA VARIABLES
  ...
  # PRODUCTION ASIA VARIABLES
  ...
```

### Helm chart publishing

This is for a repository which holds a Helm chart. It is triggered at every tag.

```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jobtome-labs/ci-templates/<REF>/helm-publish.yml'

stages:
  - push

variables:
  GOOGLE_PROJECT: "my-project"
  BUCKET_NAME: "my-charts"
```

## SSH command

This is for a repository which need to deploy through ssh.

```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jobtome-labs/ci-templates/<REF>/ssh-production.yml'

stages:
  - deploy

variables:
  SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_QUALITY: <ssh key base64 encoded>
  SSH_USER_QUALITY: admin
  SSH_HOST_QUALITY: quality.example.com
  SSH_COMMAND_QUALITY: ansible-playbook -i quality  app.yml'
  SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS_QUALITY: <known hosts file base64 encoded>
  DOMAIN_QUALITY: quality.example.com

  SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION: <ssh key base64 encoded>
  SSH_USER_PRODUCTION: admin
  SSH_HOST_PRODUCTION: production.example.com
  SSH_COMMAND_PRODUCTION: ansible-playbook -i production app.yml'
  SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS_PRODUCTION: <known hosts file base64 encoded>
  DOMAIN_PRODUCTION: production.example.com
```

## Publish to Google Calendar and Slack

We have an internal calendar where we track deployments (and maintenances and incidents through another tool). At the end of the pipeline, this stage is triggered only on success.

We use a 3rd-party tool called [GAM](https://github.com/jay0lee/GAM) for this.

For slack, we use a simple webhook.

```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jobtome-labs/ci-templates/<REF>/notify.yml'

stages:
  - notify

variables:
  GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID: <calendar ID>
  OAUTH2SERVICE: <see gam help>
  OAUTH2TXT: <see gam help>
  CLIENTSECRETS: <see gam help>
  SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: <url>
```

## Deploy to Google Storage

```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jobtome-labs/ci-templates/<REF>/bucket-production.yml'

stages:
  - deploy

variables:
  GOOGLE_PROJECT: my-project
  SYNC_MODE: copy
  DIR_TO_SYNC: public
  BUCKET_PATH: data
  GOOGLE_KEY_QUALITY: <google json key>
  GOOGLE_KEY_PRODUCTION: <google json key>
  BUCKET_NAME_QUALITY: test.website.com
  BUCKET_NAME_PRODUCTION: website.com
  BUCKET_HEADERS_QUALITY: "Cache-Control:no-cache,max-age=0"
  BUCKET_HEADERS_PRODUCTION: "Cache-Control:public,max-age=3600"
```

If unset, `GOOGLE_PROJECT` defaults to `my-project`

If unset, `SYNC_MODE` defaults to `rsync`

If unset, `DIR_TO_SYNC` defaults to `.`

If unset, `BUCKET_PATH` defaults to `data`

**NOTE: if you set "BUCKET_PATH" variable to '' and the "SYNC_MODE" variable is set to rsync you'll lose all bucket data**

```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jobtome-labs/ci-templates/<REF>/terraform.yml'

cache:
  paths:
    - "${TF_FOLDER_PATH}/.terraform"

variables:
  TF_FOLDER_PATH: platform

stages:
  - validate
  - test

```

## Terraform security score

```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jobtome-labs/ci-templates/<REF>/terraform-security.yml'

stages:

```

## Notify sentry of release

```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jobtome-labs/ci-templates/<REF>/sentry.yml'

stages:
  - notify
```

This stage makes an API call to the project-specific sentry webhook, in order to announce a new release [as per the docs](https://docs.sentry.io/workflow/releases/?platform=javascript#using-the-api).

# General advices

To test stuff in local, try to follow [this guide](https://medium.com/@umutuluer/how-to-test-gitlab-ci-locally-f9e6cef4f054).

In short:

`brew install gitlab-runner`

Before running the following command, go to your project's settings -> CI/CD, select "runners" and get the info (URL and token) specified at "Set up a specific Runner manually"

`gitlab-runner register` -> follow the wizard, select docker as your preferred executor type. When asked for a default docker image, pick a random one because it doesn't matter which one.

Now you can go in a project folder on your laptop, and run

`gitlab-runner exec docker JOBNAME`

This command will look for the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file and look for the job with the specified name.

**It is not possible to run a whole stage. _Jobs must be specifed manually_**

_As a consequence, the classic `.gitlab-ci.yml` file that imports from other yml files (the whole point of this repo) will not work_

Notice there is also [this guide](https://medium.com/@campfirecode/debugging-gitlab-ci-pipelines-locally-e2699608f4df) who doesn't register the runner... `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
